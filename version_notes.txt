Student task
January 2022
Taylor Burke

In this experiment, an independent sample of "students" will be shown the hints selected by "teachers" during the fMRI experiment, and will place bets on how likely each hypothesis is to be the correct answer. The goal of this experiment is to (1) acquire a model-independent measure of teacher quality and to (2) validate the model by comparing the model-predicted posterior belief over hypotheses with human students' bets.
